I'm a huge music fan and have been since a very young age. When I was around 10 years old I got my first guitar and immediately fell in love. Countless hours were spent learning how to play songs by my favorite bands such as Metallica, Guns-n-Roses, Megadeth, Led Zeppelin, etc.

Through middle and high school I jammed with many different musicians and played in a bunch of bands. My first 'real' gig was when I was 16 years old.

Fast forward a few years and I joined a band that would become **Scars of Life**. We went on to become a big draw in the South Florida area and play with such bands as **Sevendust, Damageplan, Drowning Pool, Static-X, Filter** and many more. We even ended up with two of our songs being picked up by the [UFC](https://www.ufc.com/) and they still use them today in their TV programming.

Our music is still available through every major streaming service and retailer. If you like heavy music, give us a listen:
