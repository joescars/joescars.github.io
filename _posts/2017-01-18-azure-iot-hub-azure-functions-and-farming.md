Late last year I had the opportunity to work with [Costa Farms](http://www.costafarms.com/) on a small proof of concept project. The goal was simple; actively monitor pH levels in their plants water supply and take intelligent action if needed.

We were able to accomplish this using [Azure IoT Hub](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/iot-hub/), [Stream Analytics](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/stream-analytics/), [Event Hubs](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/event-hubs/) and [Azure Functions](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/functions/).

You can find the full case study [here](https://microsoft.github.io/techcasestudies/iot/2016/11/03/CostaCorp.html).

In addition please find a slide deck below with additional info.
