The team over at <a href="http://www.microsoftvirtualacademy.com/" target="_blank">Microsoft Virtual Academy</a> has put together an amazing course focusing on the highlights of what we learned about Windows 10, and developing for it,Â at //build 2015.

The course is broken down into the following sections

  1. Introducing the Windows 10 App Model
  2. Windows + Open Source Software
  3. Microsoft Edge: Introducing the New Browser and Web App Platform for Windows 10
  4. Developing Universal Windows Apps in Visual Studio 2015
  5. Game Developers: Get the Most Out of Windows 10
  6. Internet of Things Overview

I highly recommend watching this free course to learn about all the new stuff coming out and how it will change the way we develop and interact with devices.
