As a guitarist, I'm always looking for ways to improve my instrument's performance and feel. When I decided to upgrade the stock tremolo system on my PRS CE24, I knew I wanted something that would deliver superior quality, better functionality, and enhanced playing experience. After researching various options, I settled on the Mannmade USA tremolo system â€“ and I couldn't be happier with the results.

## Why I Chose to Upgrade

The PRS CE24 is an exceptional guitar straight from the factory, but like many production instruments, there's always room for improvement in certain components. The stock tremolo, while functional, left me wanting more in terms of:

- **Stability**: Better tuning stability during aggressive tremolo use
- **Feel**: Smoother operation and more responsive action
- **Quality**: Higher-grade materials and superior craftsmanship
- **Sustainability**: A system that would maintain its performance over years of heavy use

## Enter Mannmade USA

Mannmade USA has built a reputation for creating some of the finest aftermarket tremolo systems available. Their attention to detail and commitment to quality made them the obvious choice for this upgrade.

### What Makes Mannmade Special

**Superior Materials and Construction**
The difference in quality between the stock PRS tremolo and the Mannmade system is immediately apparent. The Mannmade tremolo features:

- Precision-machined components with tighter tolerances
- Higher-grade steel construction
- Superior surface finishing
- More robust pivot points and knife edges

**Weight and Balance**
One of the most noticeable improvements is the weight difference. The Mannmade tremolo is significantly lighter than the stock system, which contributes to:

- Better overall guitar balance
- Reduced strain on the guitar's body
- Improved resonance and sustain
- Less fatigue during long playing sessions

## The Installation Process
