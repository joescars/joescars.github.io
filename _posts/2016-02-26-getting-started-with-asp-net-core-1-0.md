![Getting started with ASP.NET Core 1.0](/assets/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/asp-net-core-mvc-mac-osx.jpg)
This was presented at South Florida Code Camp 2016.

You can find the code from the demo here:Â <https://github.com/joescars/SFCCASPCoreDemo>

In this presentation I walk you through how to get started with ASP.NET Core 1.0. We focus on the cloud and cross platform story.

I walk you through the following:

  * High level overview of ASP.NET Core
  * How to install ASP.NET Core
  * Creating an ASP.NET Core project in Visual Studio
  * Project structure and overview
  * Local debugging and building
  * Pushing the website to Azure using local Git repository

We then switch over to the MAC and continue with the following

  * How to install and configure ASP.NET core and Visual Studio Code on the MAC
  * Pulling the project down to MAC via Git
  * Editing the project in Visual Studio Code
  * Building the project and running locally using Kestrel Web server
  * Pushing the updates back up to Azure using Git
